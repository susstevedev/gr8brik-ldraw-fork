# Rights

> to make derivative works
> to make commercial use of the CA approved LDraw Parts Library
> Under the following conditions:

> Attribution - You must give the original author credit.
> The LDraw Steering Committee (SteerCo) also holds an attribution to 'The LDraw Parts Library' in such Derivative Works to be sufficient in lieu of a full list of authors.

# Enforcements

> The single copyright holders are the sole entity responsible for enforcements of their copyrights. For purposes of enforcement LDraw.org considers the following good rules of thumb to determine if a new file is not a Derivative work. Anything else should be considered a Derivative work and an attribution would be required. If in doubt contact the current LDraw SteerCo.

> What is not considered a Derivative work?

> Rendered images generated from the LDraw library. Rendering here covers any conversion of a 3D model file into a 2D image.
> Model files containing references only (the source code for the part may NOT be included in any form) to parts in the official LDraw Parts Library at the time of their creation. Part files which are marked as unofficial at the time of creation may be included in full in the model file. If the sole or main purpose (as determined by the LDraw SteerCo in consultation with the potentially offending author and LDraw community at large) of the Model file is to include large numbers of unofficial parts then it WILL be considered a derivative work.
> Alternative libraries of parts which LDraw.org does not own or enforce the copyright. If some or more of the parts in the library are converted from the LDraw Parts Library then they must be considered a Derivative work.
